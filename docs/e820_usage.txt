; Input:
;
;	EAX	Function Code	E820h
;	EBX	Continuation	Contains the "continuation value" to get the
;				next run of physical memory.  This is the
;				value returned by a previous call to this
;				routine.  If this is the first call, EBX
;				must contain zero.
;	ES:DI	Buffer Pointer	Pointer to an  Address Range Descriptor
;				structure which the BIOS is to fill in.
;	ECX	Buffer Size	The length in bytes of the structure passed
;				to the BIOS.  The BIOS will fill in at most
;				ECX bytes of the structure or however much
;				of the structure the BIOS implements.  The
;				minimum size which must be supported by both
;				the BIOS and the caller is 20 bytes.  Future
;				implementations may extend this structure.
;	EDX	Signature	'SMAP' -  Used by the BIOS to verify the
;				caller is requesting the system map
;				information to be returned in ES:DI.
;
; Output:
;
;	CF	Carry Flag	Non-Carry - indicates no error
;	EAX	Signature	'SMAP' - Signature to verify correct BIOS
;				revision.
;	ES:DI	Buffer Pointer	Returned Address Range Descriptor pointer.
;				Same value as on input.
;	ECX	Buffer Size	Number of bytes returned by the BIOS in the
;				address range descriptor.  The minimum size
;				structure returned by the BIOS is 20 bytes.
;	EBX	Continuation	Contains the continuation value to get the
;				next address descriptor.  The actual
;				significance of the continuation value is up
;				to the discretion of the BIOS.  The caller
;				must pass the continuation value unchanged
;				as input to the next iteration of the E820
;				call in order to get the next Address Range
;				Descriptor.  A return value of zero means that
;				this is the last descriptor

;
; The BaseAddrLow and BaseAddrHigh together are the 64 bit BaseAddress of this range.
; The BaseAddress is the physical address of the start of the range being specified.
;
; The LengthLow and LengthHigh together are the 64 bit Length of this range.
; The Length is the physical contiguous length in bytes of a range being specified.
;
; The Type field describes the usage of the described address range as defined in the table below.

; Value	       Pneumonic		           Description
;   1	    AddressRangeMemory	    This run is available RAM usable by the operating system.
;   2	    AddressRangeReserved	This run of addresses is in use or reserved by the system, and must not be used by the operating system.
; Other	    Undefined		        Undefined - Reserved for future use.
